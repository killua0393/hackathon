She's sitting on the couch, clutching her chest, and says the pain feels like a heavy weight pressing down. I've tried giving her water, but it hasn't helped.

It's crucial to act quickly. First, reassure Sarah and help her sit in a comfortable position, preferably with her back supported. Loosen any tight clothing to ease breathing. If she's not allergic to aspirin and hasn't taken any today, you can give her one (325 mg) to chew slowly, as it can help thin her blood and reduce the risk of clotting during a heart attack. Stay by her side and monitor her closely. An ambulance has been dispatched and will reach you soon. Stay on the line with me, and let me know if there are any changes in Sarah's condition. Help is on the way."},
